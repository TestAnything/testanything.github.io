# TAP History
The protocol has been around since 1988.

## TAP Namespace Nonproliferation Treaty

TAP has roots from the Perl programming language. Due to conficting namespaces
in that language, many Perl TAP authors signed a "nonproliferation treaty"
with the intent to reduce namespace conflicts.

The vast range of programming languages makes the treaty difficult to
enforce across the TAP ecosystem. The
[original treaty page](/namespace-nonproliferation-treaty.html)
is included on this history page for posterity.

## Historical Versions

Pulling apart the historical revisions of TAP is difficult both because there was no standard and because t/TEST in the perl core and Test::Harness parse slightly different dialects of TAP. Here's the best we can piece together right now. This information comes from Sam Villan's historical Perl GIT repository.

### Version 1

TAP as understood by Perl 1.0's t/TEST. It understands the basic 1..M header, "ok #" and "not ok #". No blank lines, directive, garbage lines or anything else is understood.
This is implemented by t/TEST as part of Perl 1.

```
commit 840163baa12f7970131f7841c479bccf5be40ba9
Author: Larry Wall <lwall@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov>
Date:   Sat Jan 30 23:00:00 1988 +0000
```

### Version 2

Checks the wait/exit status of each test.

Implemented by Test::Harness in Perl 5.002beta3

```
commit 4bce96efdcaa480e392138e10166c92c5fc5f22c
Author: Perl 5 Porters <perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 2 18:52:27 1996 -0800
```

### Version 3

Comment lines beginning with # are ignored.

```
Implemented by Test::Harness in Perl 5.002beta3
commit 4bce96efdcaa480e392138e10166c92c5fc5f22c
Author: Perl 5 Porters <perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 2 18:52:27 1996 -0800
```

### Version 4
Adds the "1..0" header for skipping the entire test. Previously it was considered a passing test.

This is first implemented by t/TEST as part of Perl 5.003_01 followed ten minutes later by Test::Harness.

```
commit 845b835a0bd51ac2f83e2e81f4088986d97114ff
Author: Perl 5 Porters <perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 23:11:22 1996 +0000
```

### Version 5
All non-TAP lines are ignored.
Implemented by Test::Harness in Perl 5.003_01.

```
commit ae85fcb6e790acc2343e92002216642e766aa196
Author: Perl 5 Porters <perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 23:22:00 1996 +0000
```

### Version 6
Support for the skip directive.
Added in Test::Harness and allow (but ignored) in t/TEST in Perl 5.004_55.

```

            Date: Wed, 26 Nov 1997 17:16:55 -0500 (EST)
```

### Version 7
In-header "todo" syntax added to Test::Harness in Perl 5.004_59.

```
Change 539: Subject: [PATCH 5.004_59] allow the Test::Harness to grok TODO-type tests docs

```

### Version 9

```
Change 3399: more testsuite smarts (many of them courtesy Ilya)
```

    Message-ID: <20010218014850.C19957@magnonel.guild.net>
```

### Version 12
Allowed header at end.

Implemented in [Test::Harness](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/) 1.21.

### Version 13 (Current version)
