# TAP Producers

Systems which output TAP.

## Contents

## Ada

-    [Ahven](http://ahven.stronglytyped.org/) unit test library for Ada produces TAP 12 output.

## Arc (Lisp Dialect)

-    arctap.arc - can be found in the [Anarki version of Arc](http://arcfn.com/2008/02/git-and-anarki-arc-repository-brief.html), and is used for its test suite, which also has some test scripts written in Perl and test::More.

## C / C++

### C TAP Harness
Russ Alberry has a C TAP library available [here](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/).

### [GLib's GTest](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Testing.html)
Test executables that use `g_test_init()` present their results as TAP if run with the `--tap` option.

### [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) - Google C++ Testing Framework

### LibTap
-    [Original version (unmaintained)](http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/LibTap)
-    [Maintenance version by Shlomi Fish](http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/libtap/)
-    [Maintenance version by Rusty Russell as part of CCAN](http://ccan.ozlabs.org/info/tap.html)
-    [Article about LibTap](http://use.perl.org/~nik/journal/22137)
(This library appears to no longer be under active development. It also suffers from an non-POSIX thread implementation. If you remove the thread ifdefs from tap.c it does compile and run however.)

### libtap++
Libtap++ is a mostly-complete port of test::More to C++. Its main advantage over libtap is that it provides polymorphic is and isnt functions.

-    [Documentation of libtap++](http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Testing_with_C%2B%2B#Testing_using_libtap.2B.2B)
-    [Download libtap++](http://github.com/downloads/Leont/libperl--/libtap++-0.02.tar.bz2)

A fork of libtap++ that doesn't require a build time dependency to Boost is also available [here](https://github.com/cbab/libtappp).

### MyTAP (for MySQL)
MyTAP is a TAP producer for C. It is the unit testing framework used inside the MySQL Server

-    [Testing C and C++ using MyTAP](http://www.kindahl.net/mytap/doc/)
-    [MyTAP](http://theory.github.io/mytap/)

### Yet Another libtap
Another library for producing tap in C that compiles without much work on the dumbest (no special library requirements) of Unix-like and Windows development environments. It is feature-full (ok, is, isnt, like, unlike, todo, skip, dies_ok, cmp_ok, etc...), consistent (todo until endtodo, skip until endskip), extendable, and keeps track of file-line information (like test::More does). It also uses macros in nice ways so the user can leave out the message portion at the end of the test ok(1) and ok(1, "hello %s", "world") are both valid.

## Common Lisp

### cl-tap-producerX
cl-tap-producerX is a testing library for Common Lisp which produces test results in the test Anything Protocol (TAP) format. The most common usage is to print the TAP output to standard output, for use with tools such as the Perl prove utility, but other usages are possible. cl-tap-producerX supports most parts of the TAP specification, including TODO tests, skipped tests, and diagnostics. cl-tap-producerX automatically infers diagnostics in the most common usages. cl-tap-producerX is extremely light-weight with almost no boilerplate required in the most common usage scenario. Boilerplate is available for those who prefer it.
cl-tap-producerX is split into two parts - a test library which generates structured test result data, and a TAP producer which formats the structured test data to TAP output. In the most common usage, this process is transparent.

-    [Download cl-tap-producerX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cl-tap-producer/files/)

### testbild
[testbild](http://www.cliki.net/testbild), the universal test output production and consumption facility, is a Common Lisp library designed to provide a common interface for Unit testing output. Currently it supports TAP (versions 12, 13) and xUnit style output.
It is asdf-installable and also available via [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/).

## C#

### Taps
Taps is a test tool for the .NET framework. Taps compiles C# test scripts on the fly and runs them. The output of the scripts conforms to the TAP protocol. The set of test functions available to the test scripts is inspired on the test::More module.
Some features of Taps:

-    Allows a test script to run tests in multiple threads
-    Does deep comparison of complex data structures and if they are not equal outputs them annotated with a clear path to the differing item
-    Has multiple output modes: YAML, msbuild-friendly, terse
-    Supports testing of "internal" classes and methods

The project home is hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/taps-testing).
