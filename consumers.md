# TAP Consumers

TAP consumers are systems that can take TAP as an input
and do something useful with it.
This page contains a catalog of software libraries
that can act as TAP consumers,
grouped by programming language.

Languages:

## <a id="c"></a> [C](#c)

> C is an imperative (procedural) language. It was designed to be compiled
> using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access
> to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine
> instructions, and to require minimal run-time support.

**[C TAP Harness](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/)** is a
TAP library that implements much of the
[Test::More](http://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html) API along with some C
specific test functions.

**[tap-parser](https://github.com/ligurio/tap-parser)** is a TAP parser
written with YACC and Lex.

**[tapto](https://github.com/katef/tapto)** is a TAP parser that formats
results to XML and other formats.

- [tap13](https://github.com/mpontillo/tap13/) is a TAP parser that translates
input TAP into structs that can be used for further information processing.

## <a id="java"></a> [Java](#java)

> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
> class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as
> few implementation dependencies as possible.
